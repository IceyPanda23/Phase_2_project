###  An Analysis of the Impact of Health and Education Metrics on GDP for East African Countries"


## Introduction
This project aims to predict GDP (Gross Domestic Product) based on health and education metrics. We have used linear modelling to understand how the health , education metrics impact on the GDP growth in considering which East African Country to invest in.

Axis Investment and Consultancy is a world leading Wealth management, Investment Solutions and Consultancy firm that values people are part core unit in business and have vital role in business success. Axis Investment and Consultancy are looking to invest in  business but are also cognizant to economic health (GDP per capita) of the country they are based in. They believe that the health metrics of the population of East African Countries can determine if a countries are doing well economically. However, they do not have any factual  information to prove thi and decide on best performing GDP in East Africa. However, this project seeks to explore the best environments to invest based on the Health Factors, Education metrics as they have impact on GDP growth.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value created by a country on the world stage through the production of goods and services throughout a given time. GDP per capita however is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, divided by mid-year population. In simpler terms, GDP per capita is a metric that shows the economic output per person. GDP and GDP per Capita are mostly calculated yearly although quarterly calculations are common though they are not as common as the yearly ones. Both GDP and GDP per capita do similar things but GDP per capita is more preferred since it considers the population of the country.

## Project Objectives

The project goal is to find the relationship between health, education, finance metrics and GDP of the East African Countries. We strive to help Axis Investment and Consultancy undestand factors that have an  impact on the GDP growth through visual, application of statistical models like linear regression, multiple regression and correlation coeffeficient. Furthermore, this study enlightens the investors with the following

    1. Understand factors influencing GDP- Investigate correlation between Health, education metric, financial metrics and GDP of African Countries
    2. Make informed investment stategies leverage on data insights of factors influencing GDP growth.
    3. Provide strategic advisories to clients with data driven understanding of economic growth.
